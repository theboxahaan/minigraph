[-] Implement the Architecture
  [-] Implement a basic `PropertyContainer`
    [x] Implement desctructors for the `PropertyContainer` class. All `Values` contained in
        the container are free'd on `Container` deletion
    [x] implement a memleak test for `PropertyContainer`
        - memleak test using `leaks -atExit -- ../test`
    [x] add ability to catch initialisation, insertion errors to `PropertyContainer`
    [ ] shift PropertyContainer to using std::unique_ptr so that it's easier to manage destruction
        `get` should return references to the ptr but maintain ownership
    [ ] make the `get` function generic so that it doesn't depend on RTTI 
  [ ] Implement the `Node` class
